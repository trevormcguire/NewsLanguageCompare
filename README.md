# NewsLanguageCompare
Compare the language of different news outlets as it pertains to specific topics.

We first obtain part of the news database from my website ZeroSigmaNews.com and then filter by source. For each source, we train seperate word embedding models. Afterwards, we compare the language sorrounding certain topics to look for bias.
